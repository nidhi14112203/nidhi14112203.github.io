<P>The Royal Challengers Bangalore has opted to go with Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, and Mohammed Siraj. Kohli and Maxwell were to be retained as veterans of this format. AB de Villiers’ retirement made RCB’s selection headaches a little simpler since he would have been on the retention list. On the other hand, other retained players were the center of attention.
